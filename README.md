# Foodistic
This Android application is the prototype of a shopping application for a fictional group of supermarkets. The application was developed together with 2 classmates to practice some basic principles in the field of Computer-Human Interaction and UX design. 

While using the application, a user can make a profile, log in, modify their profile, view products, search for products (including applying filters on searches), make shopping lists and modify these. There's also a shopping basket in which the user can add products. 

Note that in developing this application, we focused on the CHI and UX aspects, some algorithms that were used might not be the most sophisticated out there. Also note that all data is stored locally on the device in a Room database, again for prototyping purposes and the focus on other aspects.

# Usage
If you'd like to try out the application: Install Android Studio --> Clone this repository --> Import this project in Android Studio --> Plug your Android device into your PC --> In Android Studio, under 'Available Devices', select your device --> Run the application.
